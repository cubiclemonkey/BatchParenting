# BatchParenting
Shoring up parenting with a little bit of scripting.

The goal for this small collection of scripts is to make some settings in Windows more available to parents with less knowledge of computers.

I wanted to make some tools available to parents without them having to install an application, learn anything new about Windows itself
or register themselves and their children for online accounts using native aspects of Windows itself.

Without implementing everything immediately and providing some context to parents, they have the ability to shape their own boundaries
based upon the needs of their child rather than what I can think of.

This will continue to evolve with feedback and questions from parents having success and needing different kids of support.
